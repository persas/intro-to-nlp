    "### 1.1. Motivation and challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural Language Processing or **NLP is \"*a field of artificial intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages*\"**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language carries information that humans can naturally unpack**. We take for granted the complexity inherent to language, resulting from elongated periods of evolution, most of the times bypassing languague amibiguities:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example 1: *\"John kissed his wife, and so did Sam\"*\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    - Example 2: The buffalo sentence [buffalo sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Buffalo](images/buffalo.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- From a conceptual perspective and under the assumption that we can disambiguate the language, **text is virtually the most complete source of information**. Where do we find important applications?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Relevant use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Several use cases have been identified across the industry for the use of natural language as a source of data for prediction purposes. Some [notable ones](https://medium.com/@ODSC/an-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-nlp-8e476d9f5f59):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detection of spam email**: Probably the first succesful application of NLP in the industry\n",
    "- **Recognition and prediction of diseases**: Using information such as health records or patient's own speech, conditions such as cardiovascular diseases or schizophrenia can be potentially diagnosed, with [specific services](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/) around this topic (*)\n",
    "- **Brand sentiment and customer satisfaction**: Social media data can be used for sentiment analysis, understanding the degree of customer satisfaction, brand perception and main improvement areas for businesses\n",
    "- **Recommendation systems and personal assistants**: Amazon Alexa's and Google's Nest are two powerful examples.\n",
    "- **Identification of fake news**: the NLP Group at MIT developed a new system to determine if a source is accurate or politically biased, detecting if a news source can be trusted or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Or eveeeen...\n",

    "### 2.5. The great advance: LSTM cells  and transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "While Doc2Vec makes use of Neural Networks as part of its components (see [CBOW](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/04/implementing-deep-learning-methods-feature-engineering-text-data-cbow.html) and [Skip-gram](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/04/implementing-deep-learning-methods-feature-engineering-text-data-skip-gram.html) models), **most relevant advances in NLP come hand by hand with the development of advanced deep network architectures leveraging cell memory mechanisms such as the LSTM cells**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT: RNN's\n",
    "\n",
    "Text can be seen as time series data in the sense that all previous words are relevant to understand further contents, since they create context. While the RNN architecture (recurrent neural networks) already enable learning from patterns repeated over time (time-series data) by introducing *hidden states* as representation of **previous inputs** they suffer from specific issues relating to the computation of gradients (check out [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-recurrent-neural-networks-79e5eb8049c9) for a very nice and easy introduction to RNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "[LSTM](https://medium.com/mlreview/understanding-lstm-and-its-diagrams-37e2f46f1714) (or *long short term memory*) is a network architecture that enables a model to capture both recent, syntatically-relevant information as well as previous, topic-relevant information in a balanced fashion. Below is depicted the architecture of an LSTM cell\n",
    "\n",
    "![lstm cell](images/lstm_cell.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is relevant from here is that each cell will have two outputs: the short-term memory (cell specific output) and the long-term memory (which is passed from cell to cell and altered by each cell with their own contribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "This development has proven massive in order to increase model comprehension ability as part of a wave of advanced NLP models known as transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TRANSFORMERS AND RELATED OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest NLP players are currently in a race to develop pretrained model architectures able to generalize to the widest range of tasks (measured through comprehensive benchmarks such as [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/)), with relevant advance's such as Google's [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237) or [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237). This, along with the democratization of contents promoted by the open source NLP community (such as the [Hugging Face project](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)) is making it affordable to adapt these models to pretty much any NLP task through widely supported API's such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n",
