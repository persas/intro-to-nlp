# intro-to-nlp

This project aims to give a quick overview of the NLP topic for beginners. This is a talk that my teammate Alberto Sanchez and myself gave 
on the Clarity Tech Thursdays for the whole company.

This repo contains the whole talk wrapped up in the notebook Thursdays brown bag meeting, NLP. There you'll find a introduction 
to the theoretical part of NLP as well as a quick workshop to play around with the techniques explained.
